Link
    List of coords.

Placement
    Conceptually, for a placement of order O there are O links. Each of these has the same constituents, but with
    a different zero'th member. ABC BAC CAB, for instance.

    link -- these coords are the placement itself
    dead links -- the links that specify the same placement as link
    backtrack links -- links that were removed because they conflict with link

Given order O ominos in a W by H plane, the number of placements P = (W*H)/O, which must be an integer.
Example: pentominos in a 5x5 is P = 5. trominos in a 6x6 is P = 12.

While the solution doesn't have enough placements
    backtrackIfNeeded()
    while links is empty, and solution has placements backtrack
        pop the most recent placement
        put the backtrack links back in the list
        put the dead links in the solution's reset list
    If there are no placements and no links we're dead!
    Pick a link

    Remove each link with the same constituents and put it in dead links.
        These are dead links, and will not come back. Either this tiling works, and doesn't come back,
        or we'll hit a dead end, and it means this placement isn't valid given the prior placements.

    Remove each link with *any* of the constituents and put it in backtrack links.
        There are backtrackable links, and may come back. If we backtrack, these are still valid links,
        because they're different from the one we chose.

If we exit the loop because we have enough placements, we have a solution.
If we run out of links, we have to backtrack.
