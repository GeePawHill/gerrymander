Link
    List of coords.

Placement
    Conceptually, for a placement of order O there are O links. Each of these has the same constituents, but with
    a different zero'th member. ABC BAC CAB, for instance.

    links -- the O links for the placement
    collision links -- links that were removed because they conflict with links
    examined links -- links that following moves tried to use but failed

backtrack
    placements are kept in a stack that represent the part of the move tree we're exploring
    placement = pop()
    previous = lastOrNull()
    put placement's links in previous's examined links list
        note: if you're popping the 0th placement, its links are truly dead. Put them on the solver's reset list.
    put placement's collisions in the table
    put placement's examineds in the table

reset
    backtrack until there are no placements
    restore the reset list

place
    pick a link
    links = link + its O-1 re-orderings
    remove links from table
    collisions = any table link that contains one of the placement's coordinates
    examined = []

backtrackIfNeeded
    Any time we don't have any links in the table, we've hit a dead end.
    We want to backtrack until the table has links again, which may be multiple times.
    If we still are out of links after we've emptied the stack, we have an unsolvable problem.

solve()
    generate all ominos
    generate all links
    while(placements<P)
        if backtrackIfNeeded still doesn't get links in the table
            exit with failure
        place


Given order O ominos in a W by H plane, the number of placements P = (W*H)/O, which must be an integer.
Example: pentominos in a 5x5 is P = 5. trominos in a 6x6 is P = 12.

While the solution doesn't have enough placements
    backtrackIfNeeded()
        while links is empty, and solution has placements backtrack
            pop the most recent placement
            put the collisions links back in the list
            put the dead links in the solution's reset list
        If there are no placements and no links we're dead!
    Pick a link

    Remove each link with the same constituents and put it in dead links.
        These are dead links, and will not come back. Either this tiling works, and doesn't come back,
        or we'll hit a dead end, and it means this placement isn't valid given the prior placements.

    Remove each link with *any* of the constituents and put it in backtrack links.
        There are backtrackable links, and may come back. If we backtrack, these are still valid links,
        because they're different from the one we chose.

If we exit the loop because we have enough placements, we have a solution.
If we run out of links, we have to backtrack.
